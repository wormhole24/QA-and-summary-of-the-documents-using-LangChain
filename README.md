The goal of this project was to upload some text files, and ask the large language model questions about the 
topics, and comparison between how accurate the model responds regarding the written laguage of each file. (if you want to use
other file formats you should make some changes in the codes about document reading).
Eventually there is the summary part, in which the model creates the summary of an arbitrary document you mention.

An example of using this code can be designing a chatbot that guides you along the users-instructions files of any product,
so in this manner it is quick to find your answers.
